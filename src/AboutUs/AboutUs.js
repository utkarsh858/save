SAVE was formed to save the society by systematically imparting knowledge, wisdom and values to enable the individuals to lead principle centered life and offer practical holistic services to the modern society.  Every society needs role models which can be emulated by masses. SAVE aims to nurture individuals who can excel in their personal and professional life. The core philosophy of SAVE arose from the realization that it is imperative to focus on character development in society as a necessary first step towards advancing as a people, as a nation and as a civilization. Such a society can only develop when the people are practicing the values of peace, love, respect, honesty, kindness and compassion. It is our belief that it can be achieved through value education. SAVE strongly believes in the power of value education as a tool of character development. This belief shapes all our programs and the work we do.
