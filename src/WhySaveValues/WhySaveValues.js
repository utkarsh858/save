<p class="text">Values affect our lives every moment.  They are a guiding force in all we do and pursue.  When our values are in congruence with our actions, we are in harmony. Understanding the importance of values, which unlike the foundation of a building, is the foundation of human existence, the Society for Applied Value Education aims to help people know about values and subsequently help embellish their personality by cultivating values to experience the real joyful nature of the self. We also provide a platform where they can express the inherent goodness of their heart by becoming instrumental in transforming the lives of others.</p>
<p class="text">Our world is in crisis, environmentally, socially and economically.  While global turmoil manifests at the physical level, it is really a crisis of values, for the origin is within the hearts and minds of men and women.  What are the anti-values that create violence and war?  What are the values, attitudes and communication skills that create peace, equality, dignity, belonging and well being for all?  What do we want in our world?</p>
<p class="text">Values are the essence of who we are as human beings.  They powerfully impact what we create in our lives and the world. When education has positive values at its heart, and the resulting expression of them as its aim, we will create a better world for all.  Values such as peace, love, respect, honesty, cooperation and freedom are the sustaining force of human society and progress.</p>
<p class="text">We invite you to join the Society for Applied Value Education to help make a positive difference for children, youth, families, communities, and the world.</p>
